## Web-Design-Challenge

#### Please note:

All components and requirements of this challenge have been met including some of the bonus items as described below:
<br>
1)  The __Landing__ Page contains:
    * An explanation of the project.
    * Links to each visualization page. 
    * The Sidebar contains preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.
2) Four __Visualization__ pages, each with:
   * A descriptive title and heading tag.
   * The plot for the selected comparison.
   * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
   * I have also made the primary image on each visualization clickable so that the user can choose to view it in a separate browser page, zoom in, etc.
3) A __Comparisons__ page that:
   * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
   * Each visualization is clickable and navigates to the detailed visualization page for that plot.
   * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
   * The grid is two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
4) A __Data__ page that:
   * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations. (2 tables)
   * The table is a bootstrap table component.
   * It is responsive.
   * The data came from importing the original .csv files into Pandas and exporting them back out as HTML files. 
5) All __Navbar__ requirements for the application were met including when screen sizes change using the Navbar component of bootstrap.
   For the components mentioned as __Bonus__ work:
   1) I used a different dataset.
   2) I enabled visualization navigation on every visualization page with an active state.
